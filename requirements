1. LaunchConfiguration 
    4 servers , 2 in privsub
2. AutoscalingGroup using LaunchConfiguration
3. 2cpu, 4ram, 10G gp2, ubuntu18
----------
4. IAM role attached to instances to use s3
5. LoadBalancer , LoadBalancer healthcheck, app port 80, outbound internet access
6. LB SG inbound 0.0.0.0/0:80, outbound 0.0.0.0/0:80
7. app to be deployed in privsub
8. output export LB http://url

---------
Considerations:
1. deploy servers to pubsub with ssh to troubleshoot then move them to privsub and remove ssh
2. deploy without LB to make sure it works as expected
3. bare in mind thhat it takes time for the app to be responsive so, mind the LB healthcheck
4. extra mile : Bastion host in pubsub open to ur IP only


Notes: 
- Eip remains allocated even after deleting stack
- ALB type dualstack needs ipv6 subnets
